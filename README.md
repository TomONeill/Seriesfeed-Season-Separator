# About userscripts
This is a userscript which you can use in combination with a browser extension to inject JavaScript (Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey).
This means new functionality can be added, or bugs can be fixed on (discontinued) websites.<BR />
DO NOT INSTALL USERSCRIPTS YOU DON'T TRUST! Check always for urls like the @domain tag at the top of a script before installation. Sensitive data (like usernames, passwords, or banktransactions even), may be sent to other sources.
